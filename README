1) Do you think the means and/or variances of helpfulness values may differ significantly between different products or customers?


Yes. A product with more to discuss (say something electronic) will likely have more people finding a review for it helpful than a review for a product like Q-tips. And for customers, some people will be better at describing things than others.
